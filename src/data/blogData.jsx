          <strong>The Month-End Move:</strong> If you’ve ever tried to book a moving company for the last few days of the
          month, you’ve likely encountered fully booked schedules and higher prices. This isn't a coincidence; it’s a
          direct result of supply and demand. At Guaz Movers, with 16 years of experience on Ethiopian roads, we see
          this pattern every month. Understanding why helps you plan a smarter, less stressful, and more affordable move.
        </p>
        <div className="space-y-2 rounded-3xl border border-slate/10 bg-primary/5 p-4 text-sm text-primary-dark">
          <p className="font-semibold">Why Month-Ends are Chaotic</p>
          <ul className="space-y-1 pl-4 text-xs text-primary-dark list-disc">
            <li>Lease cycle alignment aligns most your move dates within a narrow 3-4 day window.</li>
            <li>Payday timing makes the end of month the most affordable time to relocate.</li>
            <li>Companies shift offices around financial cutoffs, adding commercial demand.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          Peak pricing kicks in as trucks and crews stay fixed while demand spikes. Higher service rates, hidden rush
          fees, and limited negotiation power all increase the final quote. There’s also a higher risk of inexperienced
          crews or fly-by-night operators offering low prices but poor outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Your strategy:</strong> Aim for mid-month moves, book 3-4 weeks ahead if you must move at month-end, and
          choose weekdays to dodge the highest demand. Even a 48-hour shift away from the 30th can unlock better pricing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How Guaz Movers helps:</strong> We operate with transparent peak pricing, prioritize bookings in the
          order received, and rely on expert crew management so your belongings stay protected even during the rush.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the end of the month feels logical, it’s often the most expensive and stressful. Shift by a week or two,
          and you’ll find better rates, more availability, and a calmer moving experience.
